abstract={There are growing interests in the use of robots in collaborative environments with humans or other intelligent machines. Sensing the environment for which the robot is operating can be done in many ways, generally guided by skin-like sensors. Some of the skins are inspired by natural sensing in humans or other species. As humans, we use many of our senses, such as version, hearing, smell, and touch, to move around by avoiding colliding with other humans or objects. Different from humans, many other mammals also use whiskers as an additional sensor to help navigate around. In this paper, we demonstrate a touchless capacitive imaging-based sensor in the situation where the obstacles are in close vicinity to the robot. The proposed imaging system can sense the changes in areas near to the skin-like sensors by measuring the capacitances between the array of electrodes. A 4D sensing approach has been developed with the spatiotemporal Total Variation algorithm. The 4D operational mode gives sensors the time awareness that allows for dynamical responses and hence the better control of the robots. Several experiments are conducted to show the skin-like behaviour of this sensor by simulating various scenarios. The sensor shows the excellent ability to detect an object in its vicinity, where the depth is close to half of the planar sensor array size.},

abstract = "We present the theory of a novel stochastic algorithm for high-speed capacitance extraction in complex integrated circuits. The algorithm is most closely related to a statistical procedure for solving Laplace's equation known as the floating random-walk method. Overall computational efficiency stems from various factors: suitability to rectilinear geometries, statistical-error cancellation, selective integration over Gaussian surfaces and direct capacitance-matrix evaluation. Our analysis begins with Laplace's equation for a scalable square domain, subject to arbitrary Dirichlet conditions. A boundary-integral solution is then found, from which are obtained integrals for electric potential and electric field at the domain center. An electrode-capacitance integral is next derived. This integral is expanded as an infinite sum, and probability rules that statistically evaluate the sum are deduced. These rules define the algorithm. Three sources of numerical error associated with the algorithm have been identified. They are series-truncation error, space-discretization error and statistical error. All these errors can be adequately controlled through proper adjustment of algorithm parameters."

The method is based on the retarded first-order Taylor expansion of Green{\&}{\#}x2019;s functions on each field point, which can reduce the number of callback Green{\&}{\#}x2019;s functions and hence can solve double-surface integrals quickly. It is also based on the extraction of the common factors of different frequencies, and hence can sweep the frequency points quickly. Numerical examples are provided to validate the efficiencies of the proposed method.},

It is found, using a Boundary Element Method approach with a regular grid and an analytical treatment of the kernel matrix, a strict parallelism with the analogous system of two circular disks, in particular for the possibility of disentangle the divergences at short distances and the presence of a logarithmically divergent repulsive force, with the exception of electrodes with exactly opposite charges. With our semi-analytical approach, fully exploiting the symmetries of the problem and using very small subdomains, the capacitance coefficients of the two square capacitor are determined with a great accuracy, comparable with the best data available in the literature just for the capacitance of a single square."

Studies of finite systems employing a spherical geometry (electrons on the surface of a sphere) or a disk geometry background are numerous. The same cannot be said for a square geometry, who after all, would be the geometry of choice for quantum Hall states in a Landau gauge. A background represented by a uniformly charged square seems to be perceived as too costly from a computational point of view. By using simple transformations, we show that the Coulomb self-energy and the electrostatic potential of a uniformly charged square can be exactly calculated and poses no difficulty. The current results can be used in systematic studies of properties of finite systems of electrons embedded in a positive background in the form of a uniformly charged square."

However, there are several Monte Carlo methods that have been used to numerically estimate this capacitance to high accuracy. These include a Brownian dynamics algorithm [H.-X. Zhou, A. Szabo, J.F. Douglas, J.B. Hubbard, A Brownian dynamics algorithm for calculating the hydrodynamic friction and the electrostatic capacitance of an arbitrarily shaped object, J. Chem.
